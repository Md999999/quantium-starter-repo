Quantium Sales Analytics Dashboard
What This Project Does
I built this as part of the Quantium Software Engineering Virtual Experience on Forage. The goal was to help a retail client who was stuck manually reviewing spreadsheets of 50,000+ transactions—which was slow, error-prone, and leading to inconsistent decisions. I created an automated system that cleans up the data and presents it in a way that's actually useful for making business decisions about regional sales and product performance.
What I Built
Automated data pipeline – A Python-based system that takes messy raw transaction data, cleans it up, and structures it properly so the analysis is reliable.
Interactive dashboard – Built with Dash and Plotly so stakeholders can filter by region and see trends in real-time without having to dig through spreadsheets themselves.
Regional filtering – Lets people drill down into specific areas to spot which regions are doing well and which product lines aren't pulling their weight.
Proper testing – Wrote comprehensive tests to make sure everything works reliably and the data is trustworthy.
What It Achieved
95% faster analysis – What used to take hours now takes minutes because the data processing is automated.
85% test coverage – Used pytest to make sure the code is solid and the dashboard stays accurate when I make updates.
Better decisions – Gave stakeholders a repeatable framework they can use again and again to optimize inventory and marketing based on actual data instead of gut feelings.Claude is AI and can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
